# robertovallado.dev

This repository contains the **main landing page** for my personal domain:  
https://robertovallado.dev

Its purpose is to act as a **simple hub / entry point** that links to the different subdomains and projects hosted under this domain.

### Purpose

This site is intentionally minimal and serves as:

- A placeholder for the root domain
- A navigation page to access sub-projects

The root domain should stay **simple, fast, and boring**
>Each subdomain is responsible for its own purpose and stack.

### Deployment

This site is deployed as a **static site** and served from GitHub Pages.

### License
